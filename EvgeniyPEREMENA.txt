     "when will the devil come for you?"''
     (critical judges, strict as any)
     (my tale's beginning here repeats);
     ``it's time!'' and freedom hears my hail.
     ``make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;
     ``whose glance, provoking inspiration,
     a ball here, there a children's party;
     a cheerful glimmer on the snow
     a corpse on boards was all he found,
     a deft arrangement to his hair,
     a frequent question: ``tell me who
     a great attraction to conversing.
     a haze in me, but i grew used
     a man who's active and incisive
     a masculine disguise to aid
     a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
     a nation's wealth is, what augments it,
     a stride on petrarch's path, allayed
     across our snows of northern bleakness
     across the baltic in exchange
     across the public's toes; he steers
     across the stage; he yawns: ``ballet --
     across the years to our own time.

     after a fine career, his father
     again i see your soulful flight?
     against each other swift, small feet.
     alas, on pleasure's wild variety
     all these are charming! but to put
     all this, at eighteen years of age,
     along the fronts of darkened houses,
     along the street where slumber drowses,
     already tends too much to smile
     already yawned before the show,
     although there are no streets, no cards,
     always contented with his life,
     always monotonously gay,
     amusing, flattering with the best,
     an ode in twenty-five cantos.
     an offering ready for the ground.
     an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
     and act the humble or imperious,
     and ananas, the gold of trees.
     and band already tired of blowing,
     and bred upon the neva's brink,
     and by repentance. all this lends,
     and captive girls, by salgir20 lying.
     and country stillness: there the lyre
     and crisply crunch the morning snow.
     and dutifully shared his life
     and entered. ballroom overflowing...
     and eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
     and every day its own enjoyment?
     and every morning i awake
     and everything is cramped and loud;
     and fastens, like a term of art,
     and fatherland and grim confinement?
     and friends and friendship, soul-destroying;
     and glad he was he'd thus arranged
     and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
     and he was bored with social noise;
     and hid the bookshelf's dusty stack
     and how a country lives, and why
     and in retreat from all enjoyment
     and leant upon the granite shelf;
     and listen for the heart's first sound,
     and more than once the german baker,
     and never played a shrewder trick.
     and never stir a foot away!
     and nothing pierced his senses' blur.
     and now at last he saw the world.
     and now, my friends, i hear from you
     and on their captivating trail
     and pâté, strasbourg's deathless glory,
     and radiate a rainbow: blazing
     and satisfied with what he'd got,
     and self-oblivion was his art!
     and set off prompter than a whistle
     and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
     and so, before the world of learning,
     and soon, oh soon the storm's arrears
     and take due warning from my speech.
     and telling trochee from iambic
     and the derivative knyazhnín:8
     and the majestic, antlered royal,
     and the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
     and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,
     and then a drozhky's clopping sound
     and then a stroll in letny park.
     and then, with an enchanting grace,
     and there at large he goes patrolling
     and there, beneath your noonday sky,
     and though he liked a fiery quarrel --
     and though to do so would be daring,
     and took a mortgage on his land.
     and tried to write, but a hard session
     and truffles, which have ever been
     and up the rustling curtain crawls.
     and watch your daughters closer yet,
     and what's more, they're so supercilious,
     and when its waters were not showing,
     and where most surely notes are sped.
     and with a yawn took up his pen,
     and with his dinner, and his wife.
     and yawn in silence at the stage
     and, with it, forced renown to come --
     another page of recollection:
     applause. onegin enters -- passes
     are just as nimble as their feet.
     as fast as post-horses could go,
     as files, and scissors straight and curving,
     as horses whirled him through the dust.
     as i recall a bygone age?
     as if some goal had been achieved.
     as was the old suspicious sage,
     as well-read, though of pedant cast.
     at cleopatra, hiss her off,
     at feasts, was strong and fancy-free?
     at first madame gave him tuition,
     at first onegin's tongue produced
     at once they give a man the spleen.
     at the academic diction-book.
     battling along that watery freeway,
     before him roast beef, red and gory,
     before onegin there collected
     beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
     beside unfinished lines, a suite
     blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft,
     boo phaedra out as paralytic,
     bored with hilarity, and weary,
     boredom has just as sure an entry,
     both hearts to blaze had now expired;
     bound where the magic bow will send her,
     brushes for teeth, brushes for nails.
     brushes on thirty different scales;
     but by and large their talk's a hash
     but eugene's out from din and press:
     but god, how deadly dull to sample
     but groomed an anecdote-collection
     but i refuse to chop or change.
     but i'm allergic to the north...1
     but i, in love, was dull and dumb.
     but pantaloons, waistcoat, and frock,
     but soon the ways we trod were parted
     but was it happy, his employment,
     but when past joking he fell sick,
     but when the hour of youthful passion
     but you, blest husbands, to the end
     but, did they not corrupt society,
     but, now i've praised the queens of fashion,
     but, when he'd rushed to uncle's manor,
     by drozhkies jaunting at full power
     by naiads, one foot on the ground,
     by neva, on a summer night,
     by now he's driving home to dress.
     by will of zeus, the high and just,
     came distant horns, and gallant singing.
     can chatter, and be silent too,
     can yet keep nail-care much in mind:
     capricious belles of grand society!
     champion of rights, as in the wrong.
     complete with broad-brimmed bolivar,
     condemned to a lifetime of hard,
     converting morning to midnight,
     could not conceive how solemn grimm13
     custom is despot of mankind.
     dared clean his nails in front of him,
     days that are lost behind the curtain,
     dead ash sets no more sparks a-flying;
     dear ladies' feet fly past like hail,
     deep in moldavia the abhorred,
     diana's breast, the cheeks of flora,
     dressed like -- --,14 duly dreading
     drink in the midnight benediction,
     each in tumultuous turn descending
     earn for me the rewards of fame --
     emotion, thought, and magic sound;
     enchanted land! there like a lampion
     encore moëna,7 -- and rejoice
     ended his wild career of fashion
     enough of my loquacious lyre:
     escaped from social rhyme and reason,
     eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
     eugene attends the boulevard,
     eugene turned countryman. he tasted
     eugene was free, and as a dresser
     eugene would willingly have started
     eugene's a pedant in his dress,
     ever so roughly rocked my soul!
     evgeny read the sad epistle
     evgeny stood, with soul regretful,
     evgeny's total store of knowledge
     evgeny, hating litigation,
     exercised, under lucre's banner,
     exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
     exists for me one special pair!
     fancies once more are hotly bubbling,
     far, far from italy, his adored.
     fate saved evgeny from perdition:
     faublas'3 disciple for an age --
     felicitously every theme,
     fever of rhyme: thereby he's doubled
     finding in that no deprivation --
     fire of the cutlets' scalding fat,
     flown like an arrow, then he's given
     fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
     for friends of languor, or of fun,
     for him all sham has found rejection,
     for his old courses to be changed.
     for in our time, beyond dubiety,
     for quite a while by fortune's hand.
     for raking up historic dust
     for the footlights, this fickle traitor
     for unmeant kindness -- how he shone!
     for wood and tallow; all the range
     frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,
     friends of my ruslan and lyudmila,
     friends, foes, priests, guests, inured attendants
     frightening with all despair's disguises,
     from ball to bed behold him come;
     from boston's cloth or gossip's quote;
     from gaol to greenwood, by such fiction
     from her monsieur took on the child.
     from her my lips will learn and mark
     from million street16 came floating round;
     from the agent, with this tale to tell:
     fruits of my labour and my ink...
     full of his usual pith and wit,
     ghostlike, must trouble him who feels --
     giddy as venus when she's mounting
     glitters with hoar-frost all about.
     gripped him no more; soon they were raising
     had only debts on which to live.
     haphazard; so, to god be thanks,
     has opened up his serving-trap.
     has voices that are more resounding,
     have each asked him to a soirée:
     have other maidens, since you vanished,
     he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
     he cursed theocritus and homer,
     he ended even your employment;
     he failed to join that sharp profession
     he gave three balls a year, and rather
     he had the talent of saluting
     he lacked the slightest predilection
     he mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
     he really forced one to admire him --
     he saw that, as in cities, here
     he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,
     he stalked the drawing-rooms, remote
     he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
     he strove to achieve the appropriation
     he turns away: ``i've had enough --
     he was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     he was without that dithyrambic
     he who has lived and thought is certain
     he'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
     he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
     he'll spend before the looking-glass,
     he's bowed politely; his attention
     he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
     he's flown to talon's,4 calculating
     he's gnawed by serpent recollection,
     he's off -- this ruthless legislator
     he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
     he's viewed the boxes without passion,
     hear, once more filled with inspiration,
     her progress at the masquerade.
     here there's no conscience, here no sense;
     here's boredom, madness or pretence,
     his beefsteak with champagne, or drown
     his bow was wholly unaffected.
     his collar in its beaver braiding
     his epigrams topped up with bile.
     his father died; and (as expected)
     his father failed to understand
     his freedom, in his youth's first flower,
     his hair was fashionably curled,
     his life till dawn's already making,
     his mind, so cold and so precise.
     his strangeness, wholly unaffected,
     his strasbourg pie, or point a moral,
     his virulence that made you smile,
     his young heyday's supreme employment,
     how bold or bashful there, and here
     how brilliant with its instant tear!
     how early he'd learnt to dissemble,
     how early on he learnt to trouble
     how envious was i of the waves
     how often, when the sky was glowing,
     how soft his glance, or at discretion
     how well he donned new shapes and sizes --
     how well he knew the way to hurt --
     i could describe here his attire;
     i feel a small foot in my hand;
     i grasp a stirrup with affection,
     i have no leisure to recall;
     i know (and seek your exculpation)
     i liked his quality, the dream
     i longed, like every breaker hissing,
     i love their feet -- though i confess
     i only write like this, you know,
     i regularly take much pleasure
     i roam by the secluded lake.
     i signal to each passing sail.
     i suffered once from all the madness
     i walk the shore,17 i watch the weather,
     i was onegin's friend that season.
     i write, my heart has ceased its pining,
     i'd still like dances to this day:
     i'll feed the journalists for dinner
     i'll float in gondola's seclusion;
     i'm at your service to protect you;
     i'm grieving still, but no more tears,
     i've drawn a plan and a projection,
     i've wasted too much life away!
     idle again by dedication,
     impart such lessons as you please!
     in adam smith was his diploma;
     in casual letters of confession --
     in days of carefree aspirations,
     in fact a thorough fop, no less.
     in fact one day a note came flying
     in french onegin had perfected
     in languid silence, or the flame
     in lives that were just dawning then.
     in showing how to tell apart
     in sighs and boredom and deceits
     in taffeta of mourning black.
     in terms of poetry or passion --
     in the mazurka he was light,
     in their gay glass, the borrowed light
     in time past, objects of affection
     in winter, on the cast-iron fender,
     in, past concierge, up marble stair
     incendiary looks are slinking,
     ingenious london has been sending
     inspires your lute to sounds of sighing?
     is dressed, undressed, and dressed once more?
     is finished, and i've looked it through
     is in your poetry enshrined?''
     istómina,11 thronged all around
     it all seemed new -- for two days only --
     it fascinates by its assurance
     it frankly, i'm a firm adorer
     it mastered him in slow gradation;
     it needs no gold if a supply
     it was goodbye, monsieur l'abbé.
     it's easy, without too much fooling,
     it's my profession; he was wearing --
     it's time to drop astern the shape
     it's true, i'll not misrepresent them,
     italian nights, when i'll drink in
     its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
     just as the poet15 paints himself.
     just like a shadow, or a wife.
     just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.
     just sentries to each other calling,
     land where i learned to love and weep,
     land where my heart is buried deep.
     lend ears to my lugubrious tone:
     let me acquaint you on the nail
     let others learn from his example!
     like convicts in a dream released
     like fluff before aeolian breezes;
     locked himself up inside his den
     long since unstirred by praise and fame
     love passed, the muse appeared, the weather
     made london's dandy his professor.
     made over to them his whole lot,
     madman, can you forget their print?
     make juvenal his text, or better
     meanwhile my novel's opening section
     meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
     meticulously; in my fiction
     mills, lands and waters -- he whose goods
     monsieur l'abbé, the mediocre,
     more wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
     my africa,18 where waves break high,
     my carefree song would thus reveal
     my disillusioned glass, and yearn,
     my goddesses! where are you banished?
     my little feet, where have you vanished,
     my love for it is just as tender,
     my soul in secret gave survival;
     my thoughtless pen has stopped designing,
     myself and eugene, lest a reader
     no glance so sweet, no sigh so teasing,
     no mansions, no ballrooms, no bards.
     no moralizing from this joker;
     no one's, i swear by god! in sadness
     no word came flowing from his quill;
     no, early on his heart was cooling
     no, i was born for peace abounding
     no, never in the hottest fire
     no, not for long were belles the ruling
     no, nothing caused his heart to stir,
     not every day could he wash down
     now even didelot's tedious stuff.''
     now free, i once more weave together
     now latin's gone quite out of favour;
     now pay attention, i beseech,
     now sensitive, and now carefree,
     nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
     o adrian waves, my invocation;
     o brenta, i'll see you in dream;
     o fields -- to you i'm vowed at heart.
     o flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
     objective of his thoughts and joys:
     of blind fortuna and of men
     of boiling youth did i desire
     of calculated slander should,
     of dian's visage, in our fancies
     of eloquence, and just the same
     of entertaining the half-dead:
     of every funeral far and wide;
     of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
     of jealous girls, devote its strain?
     of jealousy, to seem to tremble
     of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
     of ladies and of freakish fops.
     of ladies' heads, and ladies' feet;
     of listening like a judge-supreme
     of love's anxiety. blessed is he
     of mind got clarity new-found;
     of mocking turn, or else a breeder
     of other's thought -- a splendid goal;
     of raging passion's surge and roll
     of recompense beyond endurance,
     of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
     of simple product supplements it.
     of the dull shores of my disfavour,
     of the most harmless, hopeless trash.
     of the terpsichorean foot.
     of useful objects that the curious
     of work made him feel sick, and still
     oh, when, and to what desert banished,
     old uncle's end was soon to be.
     on ballroom's looking-glass parquet
     on features known, but to that dreary,
     on most occasions between friends,
     on springtime grasses of the field,
     on stage are thumping without cease;
     on the seashore, with storm impending,
     on unknown ladies in the tiers;
     on waves of far niente floated,
     on words of foreign derivation,
     once more corneille's majestic story;
     once more that touch is fiercely troubling
     once more the love, once more the smart...
     one pair! i pay them memory's tribute
     one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
     one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
     onegin has outrun us all.
     onegin knew enough to savour
     onegin was assessed by many
     onegin, my good friend, was littered
     oppressed by emptiness of soul,
     or else, from far off, he could see
     or else... or else, may god forfend it!
     or for the modishly luxurious --
     or languid bosoms; and no visit
     or on the granite of the bay.
     or pine, persuade of yes or no,
     or russia's chondria, for short;
     or stirring annalistic must;
     or, with an epigram-surprise,
     our deep economist had got
     our friend katénin8 brought to bear
     our lives were flat, and what had fired
     outside and in they star the night;
     over the petersburg pavé --
     parisian taste invents for one --
     peopled my sleep, and to their theme
     poetic dreams, a brighter fire.
     poetry's sacred frenzy, made
     poets, i'll say in this connection,
     porcelain and bronzes on the table,
     proficiency to speak and write,
     project in silhouette the tops
     promptly had nothing left to give.
     proud albion's lyre is what i follow,
     punctilious in his cotton cap,
     pursue his love -- and at one bound
     put back the libel on the table
     reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
     recalling earlier loves, did we,
     recalling earlier time's romances,
     reluctant to exhaust the boy,
     retired, as he, from fashion's stream,
     rewards the music of your mind
     rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
     russia's terpsichore, shall never
     sacred to children of apollo!
     secure a secret assignation,
     see with their jugs the milk-girls go
     self-portraits only -- furthermore
     shadows that flit behind the glazing
     shall i depict with expert knowledge
     shall my sad gaze no more alight
     she'll spin this way and that, and beat
     she's up and flying through the air
     should have been analysed when caught,
     shows freedom's advocate, that strong
     shutters are opened and the soft
     sickroom attendance night and day
     silence was everywhere enthralling;

     since i'm a member of the same.

     sleep much, read little, and put down
     so circumspect, and so punctilious,
     so now be off to neva's brink,
     so pious, and so clever too,
     so pure, so spotless through and through,
     so virtuous that, no sooner seen,
     so, like childe harold, glum, unpleasing,
     some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
     some ladies preach from say and bentham,
     something like spleen, that scourge of britain,
     sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
     soon, infidelity proved cloying,
     spurs of chevalier gardes are clinking,
     spying my features, as he could,
     stalking the momentary weakness,
     startling the ingenuous with a jest,
     still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
     still everywhere the lamps are bright;
     still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     still shivering in the bitter weather
     still tumbling, devil, snake and cupid
     straight to his stall, then turns his glasses
     struck for evgeny, with its play
     stumblingly call to mind he did
     such crystalled scents as best are able
     such shadowy and leisured ways,
     such were a young rake's meditations --
     swam on the river's dreaming face,
     swaying the artless, waiting on
     taken your place, though not your throne?
     thank god, he had no inclination
     that alien scene must i now turn
     that all of russia can't contribute
     that even so my wretched style
     that isn't our immediate worry:
     that king of the satiric scene,
     that once i spent my happiest days?
     that stretched from romulus in his prime
     that there his friend kavérin's5 waiting;
     that world where every man's a critic
     that's when i'll sit down to compose
     that's where my years of youth were spent.
     that, like proud byron, i can draw
     the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     the atmosphere of youth and madness,
     the audience still is busy stamping,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     the barbs that envy's always spreading,
     the bitterness was mine -- the ice
     the blood within my withered heart,
     the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
     the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
     the cabinet behind the door
     the censor's tribute, i'll arrange:
     the charge that poets are unable
     the city's early sounds awake her;
     the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
     the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
     the flaming roses of a cheek,
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
     the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
     the gift of recognizing what
     the happiness of youth is dead,
     the heart of the professional flirt!
     the heartache that they bring lies deep.
     the hero's name's decided too.
     the highest circles are a bore.
     the horses fidget worse and worse;
     the house is packed out; scintillating,
     the illness with which he'd been smitten
     the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
     the ladies' calculated dress;
     the legatee of his relations --
     the magic voices of your stream,
     the meaning of an epigraph,
     the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
     the moderns rage against the old.
     the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,
     the murmur where the streamlet played...
     the new ballet he should be at.
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     the poet's only theme is ``i.''
     the safest place for declarations,
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     the strain of tasso's octave-rhyme!
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     the sumptuous palais shines out;
     the third day, wood and hill and grazing
     the thought of volatile renown.
     the tongue of love and of petrarch.
     the total ownership of woods,
     the usurers' voracious tribe.
     the wilful fancies of the heart.
     the world found this enough to treat
     the yard was bursting with dependants;
     their looks and language in deceit
     their lords, and thwack their palms together;
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,
     then from his cabinet he'll pass
     then from the muse there came revival:
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     then suddenly she's off, and there
     then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     then, after midday he'll be waking;
     there caustic shakhovskóy8 came in
     there didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     there gathered at the coffin-side
     there once i too strolled back and forth:
     there waited for us both the malice
     there сzerov8 shared the unwilling
     there's far too much of contradiction,
     there, where the coulisse entrance went,
     these words are not of russian stock:
     they all have richly earned a pension;''
     they buried uncle, congregated
     they don't deserve what they inspire
     they're all chained up in different fetters,
     this child of luxury and delight.
     this denizen of the coulisses
     this was the science of that passion
     though cold i am and sad; in sleep
     though years ago i used to look
     three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
     three whole hours, at the least accounting,
     through it they're known to me, and kin.
     throughout the boredom of the hours --
     till then had been dispersed and wasted --
     to all the most adored actrices,
     to blow his brains out, but in stead
     to do them all is easy game.
     to drive the swooning senses mad;
     to drown the hiss of modish wives.
     to eat and drink, then separated
     to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
     to gentlemen on every side
     to harmless idleness devoted,
     to hear what latest modes require,
     to hide a hope, to make a show
     to his disputing and his cursing;
     to kiss armida's lips, or seek
     to know the audience hears his voice.
     to lie down at her feet like slaves!
     to life grew colder than the dead.
     to mourn for russia's gloomy savour,
     to pass for cultured in our ranks.
     to private tastes we each subscribe:
     to scorn the men with whom he deals;
     to sing of others must imply
     to smother her dear feet with kissing.
     to the beginning of our days.
     to whom do you, from all the train
     tomorrow just like yesterday.
     towards his stall, the pedlar's hawking;
     treated his lessons as a ploy.
     tribute of tears, applause's shrilling,
     twin lamps of serried coupés throw
     twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
     two verses of the aeneid.
     uncle, in bed, and near to dying,
     under the table's linen shield,
     unforced, as conversation passed,
     until bréguet's unsleeping chime
     untirable, at sound of drum:
     up to the porch our hero's driven:
     wanders in a distracted way
     was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
     was it for you that i became
     was it not in such sweet employment
     was it to no effect that he,
     was quite beyond his wit, we found.
     we all meandered through our schooling
     we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
     we'd better hasten to the ball,
     what flowers of spring display your dint?
     what occupied his chafing powers
     what traps he'd set him, with what malice
     what? invitations? yes, three houses
     whatever for caprice of spending
     when bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming
     when comes my moment to untether?
     when little notes come on a tray.
     when out to burst a rival's bubble,
     when shall i start on my escape?
     where he was master of his college,
     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
     where the prize-boy of fashion's college
     where you were born as well, i think,
     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
     which held him silently subjected,
     which i myself won't praise or blame
     which one comes first? it's just the same
     which ovid sang, for which the bard,
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     while petersburg's already rousing,
     while roar of violins contrives
     while serious topics were disputing,
     who can combine it with the free
     who late at night are whirled away
     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
     why fight what's known to be decisive?
     will in my soul be hushed and dying.
     wine of the comet6 fills the cup;
     wished him to come and say farewell.
     with a venetian maiden who
     with amber pipes from tsaregrad;12
     with any torture so exquisite
     with brilliant conquests by the shower,
     with combs, and steel utensils serving
     with comedies of swarm and din;
     with cranium aching fit to split;
     with fond caress? whose adoration
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     with lampions studded all about
     with me to see an alien strand;
     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
     with sabre's slash, and bullet's blast.
     with shelves of books deployed for action,
     with this the hero of my tale:
     with young semyónova,9 and there
     without preliminary feeler
     yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
     yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
     yet he fell out of love at last
     yet sweeter far, at such a time,
     yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
     you husbands, deeply i respect you!
     you kept your friendship with our friend:
     you left no steps that could be tracked:
     you loved the opulent contact
     you newborn work, and like a winner
     you too, mamas, i pray attend it,
     you too, prime beauties in your flower
     you were the first ones he forswore;
     your chorus, is it dead for ever?
     your curiosity is burning
     your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
     youth's choice, the flower of french cuisine:
