     and scorned his fellows through and through,
     and self-oblivion was his art!

     and so they lived, two ageing mortals,
     and so, before the world of learning,

     and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,
     and then a drozhky's clopping sound
     and then a stroll in letny park.
     and then it's tea that comes to mention,
     and then, with an enchanting grace,
     and there at large he goes patrolling
     and there, beneath your noonday sky,
     and though he liked a fiery quarrel --
     and though to do so would be daring,

     and thus our race, so fluctuating,
     and to it, with a grave import,

     and truffles, which have ever been

     and with his dinner, and his wife.
     and wore his dressing-gown to dine.
     and yawn in silence at the stage
     and yet a distant admonition
     and yet inseparably present,
     and, in the district, this persona
     and, with it, forced renown to come --

     are just as nimble as their feet.
     are old times, and the servants' hall.
     as fast as post-horses could go,
     as fate's mysterious purpose burrows,
     as files, and scissors straight and curving,
     as gay as morning and as clear,
     as horses whirled him through the dust.
     as i recall a bygone age?
     as if some goal had been achieved.
     as infant sleep, or the unaffected
     as soon as he appears, discussion
     as was the old suspicious sage,
     as well-read, though of pedant cast.
     as, lovingly, in his confession,
     at a friend's word, a girl's caress.
     at any other sort of book.
     at cleopatra, hiss her off,
     at feasts, was strong and fancy-free?
     at first madame gave him tuition,
     at first onegin's tongue produced
     at first they called; but on perceiving
     at first, disparity of heart
     at first, with god knows whom to see,

     at once they give a man the spleen.

     before him roast beef, red and gory,
     before it was the golden play
     before onegin there collected
     beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
     beneath the stone reposes here,
     beside unfinished lines, a suite
     between their girls and this half-russian.
     between them, every topic started
     bitter-sweet glory's inspiration,
     blooms when there's nothing else to do.
     blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft,
     boo phaedra out as paralytic,
     bored with hilarity, and weary,
     boredom has just as sure an entry,
     both hearts to blaze had now expired;
     both set him yawning just as much.
     bound where the magic bow will send her,
     brushes for teeth, brushes for nails.
     brushes on thirty different scales;
     but all concurred that, truth to speak,
     but by and large their talk's a hash
     but eugene's out from din and press:
     but friendship, as between our heroes,
     but god, how deadly dull to sample
     but groomed an anecdote-collection
     but i refuse to chop or change.
     but i'm allergic to the north...1
     but i, in love, was dull and dumb.
     but in an earlier age retarded,
     but in his songs kept pride of place
     but in that desert his attainments
     but in the old days she had heard
     but it was passion that preempted
     but it's the first time you'll have known it,
     but it's the talent for concealing
     but ladies' hands are not for kissing;
     but meanwhile let him live, and think
     but never asked her husband first.
     but now it bores me every minute.
     but pantaloons, waistcoat, and frock,
     but scarcely understood a word.
     but soon the ways we trod were parted
     but was it happy, his employment,
     but when past joking he fell sick,
     but when the hour of youthful passion
     but you, blest husbands, to the end
     but, did they not corrupt society,
     but, in a fearful huff, his thrifty
     but, now i've praised the queens of fashion,
     but, when he'd rushed to uncle's manor,
     but, without asking, they transported
     by any itch for marriage ties;
     by deep and shady woods protected;
     by drozhkies jaunting at full power
     by judgement of the modern camp
     by naiads, one foot on the ground,
     by neva, on a summer night,
     by now he's driving home to dress.
     by the cold world's corrupt finesse;
     by way of secret tome that slept
     by will of zeus, the high and just,
     came distant horns, and gallant singing.
     came driving to his country seat,

     compassion, yes, and indignation,
     complete with broad-brimmed bolivar,
     condemned to a lifetime of hard,
     consequences of hideous woe;
     conversing in a singsong voice;
     converting morning to midnight,
     could not conceive how solemn grimm13
     could see no harm in books; himself

     custom is despot of mankind.
     custom's bestowed us from on high.
     dared clean his nails in front of him,
     days that are lost behind the curtain,
     dead ash sets no more sparks a-flying;
     dear ladies' feet fly past like hail,
     deep in moldavia the abhorred,
     devoted to the muse, or learning,
     diana's breast, the cheeks of flora,
     dressed like -- --,14 duly dreading
     drew scrutiny no less complete --

     each in tumultuous turn descending

     earth's rim grows light, and a forewarning
     emotion, thought, and magic sound;
     empire, and fled it; happier still
     enchanted land! there like a lampion
     encore moëna,7 -- and rejoice
     ended his wild career of fashion

     enough of my loquacious lyre:
     ensconced beside the window-pane.
     escaped from social rhyme and reason,
     eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
     eugene attends the boulevard,
     eugene turned countryman. he tasted
     eugene was free, and as a dresser
     eugene would willingly have started
     eugene's a pedant in his dress,
     eugene, with solemn face, paid heed,
     even in our names (and how much worse
     even without me it will sink;
     ever so roughly rocked my soul!
     evgeny read the sad epistle
     evgeny stood, with soul regretful,
     evgeny's total store of knowledge
     evgeny, hating litigation,
     excited not a hint of passion:
     exercised, under lucre's banner,
     exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
     exists for me one special pair!

     fancies once more are hotly bubbling,
     far more than most who leave this life.
     far, far from italy, his adored.
     farewell the games of golden childhood!
     fate saved evgeny from perdition:
     faublas'3 disciple for an age --
     feeling is quaint, and fit for fools.
     feelings he valued -- from outside.
     felicitously every theme,
     fever of rhyme: thereby he's doubled
     fieldwork directed from the path,
     finding in that no deprivation --
     fire of the cutlets' scalding fat,
     flown like an arrow, then he's given
     folly for me to interfere
     fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
     for 1808: his obligations
     for friends of languor, or of fun,
     for grumbling, gossiping and swearing
     for him all sham has found rejection,
     for him, the objective on life's chart
     for his old courses to be changed.
     for in our time, beyond dubiety,
     for it was custom that consoled her
     for maybe fortune will have saved
     for olga, on the spreading lawn,
     for quite a while by fortune's hand.
     for raking up historic dust
     for she was bored by laughs and noise
     for the footlights, this fickle traitor
     for the sublime, and for the passions
     for them by fathers who, as friends
     for them, in butterweek5 the greaseful,
     for unmeant kindness -- how he shone!
     for us are instruments and tools;
     for wood and tallow; all the range
     fortunate one, he'd not disgrace;
     forty years long would criticise
     fragments of poems from the north,
     freedom's enthusiastic dream,
     frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,
     friends of my ruslan and lyudmila,
     friends, foes, priests, guests, inured attendants
     friendship, as i must own to you,
     frightening with all despair's disguises,
     from ball to bed behold him come;
     from boston's cloth or gossip's quote;
     from day to day she could but wait;
     from drowning's death in lethe river
     from early on she loved romances,
     from gaol to greenwood, by such fiction
     from german realms of mist and steam,
     from her monsieur took on the child.
     from her my lips will learn and mark
     from million street16 came floating round;
     from that rough spell at last exempted,
     from the agent, with this tale to tell:
     fruit liqueurs and an almanack
     fruits of my labour and my ink...
     full of his usual pith and wit,
     full of obedience and demureness,
     ghostlike, must trouble him who feels --
     giddy as venus when she's mounting
     girls' albums, signed in blood for choice;
     glitters with hoar-frost all about.
     good-looking, in the flower of age,
     gripped him no more; soon they were raising
     grows, surges, boils, for lack of room
     had left the squire no time to look
     had only debts on which to live.
     haphazard; so, to god be thanks,
     happy is he who's known its fretful
     has never staked his family seat.
     has opened up his serving-trap.
     has voices that are more resounding,
     hate, love, joy, sorrow -- every feeling,
     have each asked him to a soirée:
     have other maidens, since you vanished,
     he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
     he changed the corvée of tradition
     he cursed theocritus and homer,
     he destined olga's hand for me,
     he ended even your employment;
     he failed to join that sharp profession
     he fed on hope's deceptive dinner;
     he fell in love with darkest wildwood,
     he fled from their resounding chatter!
     he gave three balls a year, and rather
     he had the talent of saluting
     he lacked the slightest predilection
     he mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     he never took one from the shelf,
     he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
     he really forced one to admire him --
     he rested -- wept for by his neighbours,
     he roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
     he sang of grief and parting-time,
     he sang of lifetime's yellowed page --
     he sang of love, to love subjected,
     he saw that, as in cities, here
     he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,
     he smiled as lensky talked: the heady
     he stalked the drawing-rooms, remote
     he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
     he strove to achieve the appropriation
     he struggled to bite back the chilling
     he sweetened up with fancy's icing
     he turns away: ``i've had enough --
     he was a good and simple barin;6
     he was a menace, and a freak.
     he was a poet in his day.
     he was convinced, a kindred creature
     he was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     he was too young to have been blighted
     he was without that dithyrambic
     he who has cooled down love with parting,
     he who has lived and thought is certain
     he'd brought back all the fruits of learning
     he'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
     he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
     he'll spend before the looking-glass,
     he's a freemason too; for him,
     he's bowed politely; his attention
     he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
     he's flown to talon's,4 calculating
     he's gnawed by serpent recollection,
     he's off -- this ruthless legislator
     he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
     he's viewed the boxes without passion,

     her clever husband on the morrow
     her father, kindly, well-regarded,
     her feelings were far more inclined --
     her girlhood games; in them he'd shared,
     her grief, and nearly ran away.
     her little friends, tatyana'd yawn,
     her loving spouse with approbation
     her progress at the masquerade.
     her tender touch had never fingered
     her to the altar and the crown.
     here there's no conscience, here no sense;
     here's boredom, madness or pretence,
     here's tea that olga's been preparing;

     his beefsteak with champagne, or drown
     his bow was wholly unaffected.
     his children and his faithful wife,
     his collar in its beaver braiding
     his conscience's record, and so
     his epigrams topped up with bile.
     his father died; and (as expected)
     his father failed to understand
     his freedom, in his youth's first flower,
     his hair was fashionably curled,
     his housekeeper and her department
     his life till dawn's already making,
     his life went sailing in calm weather;
     his mind, in judgement still unsteady,
     his mind, so cold and so precise.
     his parents' patriarchal dust
     his serfs rejoicing at their lot.
     his sobs, where his live tears were flowing;
     his song was limpid in its tune
     his soul still blossomed out, and lighted
     his strangeness, wholly unaffected,
     his strasbourg pie, or point a moral,
     his tale of youthful love, narrated
     his virulence that made you smile,
     his wife, just like tatyana, had
     his young heyday's supreme employment,
     hold half the world still unreleased,
     homestead, before her parents' gaze,
     honest devotion to the good,
     how bold or bashful there, and here
     how brilliant with its instant tear!
     how early he'd learnt to dissemble,
     how early on he learnt to trouble
     how envious was i of the waves
     how many times i made a toy
     how often, when the sky was glowing,
     how soft his glance, or at discretion
     how well he donned new shapes and sizes --
     how well he knew the way to hurt --
     i could describe here his attire;
     i don't know why, but for my friend
     i feel a small foot in my hand;
     i grasp a stirrup with affection,
     i have no leisure to recall;
     i know (and seek your exculpation)
     i know it, in the thoughts of all
     i know too surely how it ends.
     i liked his quality, the dream
     i longed, like every breaker hissing,
     i love their feet -- though i confess
     i never lived or wrote for praise;
     i only write like this, you know,
     i regularly take much pleasure
     i roam by the secluded lake.
     i signal to each passing sail.
     i suffered once from all the madness
     i thank him without reservation,
     i walk the shore,17 i watch the weather,
     i was onegin's friend that season.
     i write, my heart has ceased its pining,
     i'd still like dances to this day:
     i'll feed the journalists for dinner
     i'll float in gondola's seclusion;
     i'm at your service to protect you;
     i'm blind to every apparition;
     i'm grieving still, but no more tears,
     i've drawn a plan and a projection,
     i've wasted too much life away!
     idle again by dedication,
     if her cross mood was at its worst --
     immortals picked by fate for when,

     in adam smith was his diploma;
     in casual letters of confession --
     in days of carefree aspirations,
     in deepest grasses, quite alone,
     in fact a thorough fop, no less.
     in fact one day a note came flying
     in french onegin had perfected
     in grief that nothing else could mend;
     in heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,
     in her own home. she never took
     in his defence, and smash it up;
     in his first dream of passion's fruit,
     in his small shack, will listen well
     in languid silence, or the flame
     in lives that were just dawning then.
     in olga everything expresses --
     in play with her obedient doll
     in sensible old-fashioned style.
     in showing how to tell apart
     in sighs and boredom and deceits
     in silence all day she'd remain
     in stead of happiness, say i,
     in taffeta of mourning black.
     in tears and violent tossing vented
     in terms of poetry or passion --
     in the mazurka he was light,
     in the saloon, brocade-surrounded,
     in the white heat of some dissension
     in their gay glass, the borrowed light
     in time past, objects of affection
     in winter was her heart's delight.
     in winter, on the cast-iron fender,
     in winter, when for longer time
     in, past concierge, up marble stair

     it all seemed new -- for two days only --
     it blabs, and spills them in its tracks.
     it fascinates by its assurance
     it frankly, i'm a firm adorer
     it had no sparkle of sensation,
     it lacked, of course, poetic heart,
     it led him, in these early sessions,
     it mastered him in slow gradation;
     it needs no gold if a supply
     it stood, defiant of destruction
     it touched with reverie her leisure,
     it was goodbye, monsieur l'abbé.
     it will be our descendants who
     it would be painful to depart

     its wayward tricks, its violent surging,
     its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
     just as the poet15 paints himself.
     just before dinner, from his labours
     just like a shadow, or a wife.
     just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.
     just sentries to each other calling,
     kept asking: "shall i live to see"...''
     lacing her stays up very tightly;
     land where i learned to love and weep,
     land where my heart is buried deep.

     lensky composed in autograph
     lensky disliked the entertainments
     lensky ingenuously related
     lensky of course was quite untainted
     lensky, restored to his manorial
     let me acquaint you on the nail
     let others learn from his example!
     like a true friend, to speak my name.
     like convicts in a dream released
     like fluff before aeolian breezes;
     locked himself up inside his den
     long since unstirred by praise and fame
     look through the pane, and squash the flies.
     looked on a river: far away
     love passed, the muse appeared, the weather
     loved someone else, not her intended,
     lovelace, or grandison, or neither;
     made london's dandy his professor.
     made over to them his whole lot,
     madman, can you forget their print?
     make juvenal his text, or better
     meantime she'd give the maids a beating
     meanwhile another new landowner
     meanwhile my novel's opening section
     meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
     meticulously; in my fiction
     mills, lands and waters -- he whose goods
     misunderstanding, noise, and blame!
     monsieur l'abbé, the mediocre,
     more tolerant in his conception
     more wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
     mushrooms in brine, for winter eating,

     my africa,18 where waves break high,
     my carefree song would thus reveal
     my disillusioned glass, and yearn,
     my goddesses! where are you banished?
     my little feet, where have you vanished,
     my love for it is just as tender,
     my soul in secret gave survival;
     my thoughtless pen has stopped designing,
     myself and eugene, lest a reader
     napoleon's our sole inspiration;
     neighbour was sure, from this would flow
     neighbours and friends in kindly group,
     no beauties of a foreign clime,
     no glance so sweet, no sigh so teasing,
     no ice and flame, no stormy weather
     no mansions, no ballrooms, no bards.
     no moralizing from this joker;
     no noise of gaiety, no time
     no one's, i swear by god! in sadness
     no trace of ink, no spots, no stains.

     no years of absence past returning,
     no, early on his heart was cooling
     no, i was born for peace abounding
     no, never in the hottest fire
     no, not for long were belles the ruling
     no, nothing caused his heart to stir,
     no, soon she changed her old demeanour:
     not even in her earliest age;
     not every day could he wash down
     not separation's chilling power,
     nothing could alter or could tire
     now even didelot's tedious stuff.''
     now free, i once more weave together
     now latin's gone quite out of favour;
     now pay attention, i beseech,
     now sensitive, and now carefree,
     nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
     o adrian waves, my invocation;
     o brenta, i'll see you in dream;
     o fields -- to you i'm vowed at heart.
     o flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
     oak-floored, and simple as a stable:
     objective of his thoughts and joys:
     of blind fortuna and of men
     of boiling youth did i desire
     of calculated slander should,
     of calm and reason, when the flame
     of childish pranks: a chilled reaction
     of children, though as young as they,
     of dian's visage, in our fancies
     of eloquence, and just the same
     of entertaining the half-dead:
     of evening, and those tears, the balm
     of every funeral far and wide;
     of fate, and life, each in its turn
     of his ochákov7 decoration!
     of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
     of hope sometimes disturbs my heart;
     of human friendship, holy men,
     of innocence: a lily blooming
     of jealous girls, devote its strain?
     of jealousy, to seem to tremble
     of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
     of ladies and of freakish fops.
     of ladies' heads, and ladies' feet;
     of light that flowering fields reflected:
     of listening like a judge-supreme
     of love's anxiety. blessed is he
     of many distant lands he sang
     of mind got clarity new-found;
     of mocking turn, or else a breeder
     of neighbouring owners of the earth --
     of other's thought -- a splendid goal;
     of passion's out, and its whole manner
     of raging passion's surge and roll
     of recompense beyond endurance,
     of richardson and of rousseau.
     of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
     of secret pain... but it's now rated
     of simple product supplements it.
     of something vague, some misty clime;
     of the dull shores of my disfavour,
     of the most harmless, hopeless trash.
     of the terpsichorean foot.
     of useful objects that the curious
     of virgin fancy, and again
     of waiting for the dawn to blush,
     of work made him feel sick, and still

     on richardson gone raving mad.
     on springtime grasses of the field,
     on stage are thumping without cease;
     on the dull life that bachelors lead;
     on the seashore, with storm impending,
     on this unstable life, my friends!
     on unknown ladies in the tiers;
     on waves of far niente floated,
     on words of foreign derivation,

     once more corneille's majestic story;
     once more that touch is fiercely troubling
     once more the love, once more the smart...
     once on the highway he'd detected
     one customary grief each hour!
     one customary object gleaming,
     one pair! i pay them memory's tribute
     one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
     one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
     onegin has outrun us all.
     onegin knew enough to savour
     onegin spoke about its flights
     onegin swiftly came to know
     onegin was assessed by many
     onegin, my good friend, was littered
     only to eugene showed their worth;

     something to rack his brains about,
     sometimes the evening brought together
     sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
     soon a great truth came to enfold her
     soon all that went without a wrench:
     soon, infidelity proved cloying,
     spread out its shadow all around --

     stalking the momentary weakness,
     startling the ingenuous with a jest,

     still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
     still everywhere the lamps are bright;

     still tumbling, devil, snake and cupid

     tatyana had a changeling look
     tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
     tatyana never knew the attraction

     thank god, he had no inclination

     that all of russia can't contribute
     that ardent youth entirely lacks;
     that corps of social legislation --
     that even so my wretched style
     that fired his soul, to burn the same;
     that from the backdoor he'd be leaving
     that isn't our immediate worry:

     the art he'd studied best of all,
     the atmosphere of youth and madness,
     the audience still is busy stamping,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     the barbs that envy's always spreading,
     the better to dispel her sorrow
     the bitterness was mine -- the ice
     the blood within my withered heart,
     the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
     the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
     the cabinet behind the door
     the censor's tribute, i'll arrange:
     the charge that poets are unable
     the charm of what was grave and plain.
     the child prepares for protocol --
     the château was of a construction
     the city's early sounds awake her;
     the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     the crown of marriage was projected
     the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
     the evening passes, and meanwhile
     the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
     the flaming roses of a cheek,
     the fleeting works of my creation,
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
     the funeral monument explains:
     the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
     the gift of recognizing what
     the happiness of youth is dead,
     the heart of the professional flirt!
     the heartache that they bring lies deep.
     the hero's name's decided too.
     the highest circles are a bore.
     the horses fidget worse and worse;
     the house is packed out; scintillating,
     the illness with which he'd been smitten
     the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
     the ladies' calculated dress;
     the latest fashions of the town;
     the laurel in the old man's crown!     the legatee of his relations --
     the linen stretched on the tambour.
     the magic voices of your stream,
     the manor house, in deep seclusion,
     the meaning of an epigraph,
     the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
     the millions of two-legged creation
     the moderns rage against the old.
     the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,
     the murmur where the streamlet played...
     the muses' lofty arts and fashions,
     the needle, never had she lingered
     the new ballet he should be at.
     the noise their rustic wheels projected --
     the other, jugs of applejack,
     the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
     the peaceful muses' devotee,
     the pensive dryads' hiding-ground.
     the place where eugene loathed his leisure
     the poet's heart found full expression,
     the poet's only theme is ``i.''
     the prejudices of the ages,
     the rosy bloom that glowed so newly
     the russian n, like n in french;
     the rustic sage, in that apartment,
     the safest place for declarations,
     the secret of her husband's measure,
     the secrets of the grave, the pages
     the shades of night within their keeping
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,
     the stars, the moon -- celestial light
     the strain of tasso's octave-rhyme!
     the strophe over which i slaved;
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     the sumptuous palais shines out;
     the third day, wood and hill and grazing
     the thought of volatile renown.
     the thoughts of my two anchorites.
     the tolerant evgeny heard --
     the tongue of love and of petrarch.
     the total ownership of woods,
     the uncertainties within his heart;
     the units are ourselves alone.
     the universe is all perfection;
     the usurers' voracious tribe.
     the vote was passed without demur.
     the wilful fancies of the heart.
     the world found this enough to treat
     the world's éclat, its thunder-roll,
     the yard was bursting with dependants;
     their breed would (some years after this)
     their guests, for all they ate and drank,
     their hand to grapple slander's cup,
     their looks and language in deceit
     their lords, and thwack their palms together;
     their talk, so sound on every matter,
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,
     then from his cabinet he'll pass
     then from the muse there came revival:
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     then liking grew, then every day
     then suddenly she's off, and there
     then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     then, after midday he'll be waking;
     then, help me god, she caterwauls:
     then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
     there any friend of harmless pleasure
     there caustic shakhovskóy8 came in
     there didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     there gathered at the coffin-side
     there once i too strolled back and forth:
     there too, he honoured, hotly weeping,
     there waited for us both the malice
     there сzerov8 shared the unwilling
     there's far too much of contradiction,
     there, where the coulisse entrance went,
     these words are not of russian stock:
     they all have richly earned a pension;''
     they buried uncle, congregated
     they don't deserve what they inspire
     they met on horseback; quickly they
     they needed kvas like air; at table
     they rise and ripen and fall dead:
     they took offence at this, and broke
     they were her only food... and so
     they're all chained up in different fetters,
     this child of luxury and delight.
     this denizen of the coulisses
     this grandison of hers was splendid,
     this soul that glowed with virgin fire.
     this was the science of that passion
     those walks amid the gloom and calm
     though cold i am and sad; in sleep
     though years ago i used to look
     thought them a pointless peccadillo;
     thoughts of a girl, or as the moon
     three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
     three whole hours, at the least accounting,
     through heaven's expanse serenely flying,
     through it they're known to me, and kin.
     throughout the boredom of the hours --
     throughout their life, so calm, so peaceful,
     till he at last was summoned down
     till then had been dispersed and wasted --
     to all the most adored actrices,
     to bee and butterfly unknown.
     to blow his brains out, but in stead
     to catch the eye and to attract.
     to do them all is easy game.
     to drive the swooning senses mad;
     to drown the hiss of modish wives.
     to eat and drink, then separated
     to eugene all was new and thrilling;
     to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
     to gentlemen on every side
     to harmless idleness devoted,
     to hear what latest modes require,
     to hide a hope, to make a show
     to high renown my doleful story,
     to his disputing and his cursing;
     to horror-stories told at night
     to institute a new regime.
     to kiss armida's lips, or seek
     to kissing or caressing father
     to know the audience hears his voice.
     to lie down at her feet like slaves!
     to life grew colder than the dead.
     to liven with a silk atour
     to mourn for russia's gloomy savour,
     to pass for cultured in our ranks.
     to pass the time was eugene's theme:
     to private tastes we each subscribe:
     to put on chains for him, and steady
     to scorn the men with whom he deals;
     to sing of others must imply
     to smother her dear feet with kissing.
     to tales that young moustachios tell.
     to the beginning of our days.
     to the first meanings of his flute.
     to us, though, not exactly new.
     to which so oft we've dedicated
     to whom do you, from all the train
     tomorrow just like yesterday.
     took her to his estate, where she,
     touches obliquely, but with speed,
     towards his stall, the pedlar's hawking;
     treated his lessons as a ploy.
     treaties of nations long departed,
     tribute of tears, applause's shrilling,
     trusted her without hesitation,
     twin lamps of serried coupés throw
     twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
     two cupboards, one divan, a table,
     two verses of the aeneid.
     uncle, in bed, and near to dying,
     under the table's linen shield,
     unforced, as conversation passed,
     until bréguet's unsleeping chime
     until the dawn beneath her pillow.
     untirable, at sound of drum:
     untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
     up to the porch our hero's driven:
     upon the side of the distaff --
     villages flickered far and near,
     vladimir lensky, whose creator
     vladimir, wealthy and good-looking,
     wakened at the same hour of night
     wanders in a distracted way
     was an enchanting country nook:
     was asked around as quite a catch --
     was göttingen, his alma mater,
     was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
     was it for you that i became
     was it not in such sweet employment
     was it to no effect that he,
     was quite beyond his wit, we found.
     was still mysterious and enticing --
     we all meandered through our schooling
     we must confess that taste deserts us
     we sometimes like to hear again
     we too shall find our hour is waiting;
     we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
     we'd better hasten to the ball,
     were served in order of their rank.
     what flowers of spring display your dint?
     what it's transported to our shore
     what occupied his chafing powers
     what of it? it's euphonious, pleasant,
     what traps he'd set him, with what malice
     what? invitations? yes, three houses
     whatever for caprice of spending
     when bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming
     when comes my moment to untether?
     when little notes come on a tray.
     when not quite eighteen years of age.
     when out to burst a rival's bubble,
     when shall i start on my escape?
     when we begin to talk of verse);
     when we've retreated to the banner
     when, in pale sky, the stars' procession
     whenever nyanya had collected
     where he was master of his college,
     where in the heart of silence rang
     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
     where the prize-boy of fashion's college
     where you were born as well, i think,
     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
     which held him silently subjected,
     which i myself won't praise or blame
     which one comes first? it's just the same
     which ovid sang, for which the bard,
     which, listening with some condescension,
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     while petersburg's already rousing,
     while roar of violins contrives
     while serious topics were disputing,
     whisper of breeze announces morning,
     who can combine it with the free
     who late at night are whirled away
     who on a deuce, that famous cheat,
     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
     whose kindly hand will ruffle down
     whose memory will preserve for me
     why fight what's known to be decisive?
     wild as a forest deer, and fearful,
     will in my soul be hushed and dying.
     wine of the comet6 fills the cup;
     wished him to come and say farewell.
     with a venetian maiden who
     with amber pipes from tsaregrad;12
     with any torture so exquisite
     with brilliant conquests by the shower,
     with combs, and steel utensils serving
     with comedies of swarm and din;
     with cranium aching fit to split;
     with deep emotion through and through,
     with eugene proved a tempting prize.
     with fond caress? whose adoration
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     with irresistible refulgence,
     with lampions studded all about
     with lines to mark where they were sleeping...
     with me to see an alien strand;
     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
     with sabre's slash, and bullet's blast.
     with shelves of books deployed for action,
     with sighs unconsciously regretful.
     with such a blissful, brief infection --
     with tenderness he'd watched and noted
     with this the hero of my tale:
     with young semyónova,9 and there
     without preliminary feeler
     word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer
     would be allied to him by fate;
     would bless the form his fortune took.
     yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
     yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
     yet he fell out of love at last
     yet how i wish that i might raise
     yet sweeter far, at such a time,
     yet, as each rule has its exception,
     yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
     you husbands, deeply i respect you!
     you kept your friendship with our friend:
     you left no steps that could be tracked:
     you loved the opulent contact
     you newborn work, and like a winner
     you too, mamas, i pray attend it,
     you too, prime beauties in your flower
     you were the first ones he forswore;
     you're sure to find her portrait in it:
     your chorus, is it dead for ever?
     your curiosity is burning
     your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
     youth is a fever; we must spare
     youth's choice, the flower of french cuisine:
